👋 Hi, I’m @SoupGuyy
👀 I’m interested in aviation, simulation, and creating cinematic experiences in MSFS.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced editing techniques for MSFS cinematics.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MSFS mods, liveries, or cinematic trailers.

⚡ Fun fact: I recently launched a Discord server for MSFS with another Cinematic creator for MSFS, Fish Aviation!
